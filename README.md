# Java Hotel Reservation

This repository is an academic project developed for learning purposes only.  
It simulates a simple hotel reservation system built in Java, evolving across three distinct versions to demonstrate improvement over time — from a very poor implementation to a solid and well-structured one.

## Project Goal

The main objective of this project is to:
- Practice Git and GitHub (commits, branches, tags, releases, etc.)
- Observe progressive code improvement and refactoring across versions
- Understand the importance of code organization, naming conventions, and software design
- Develop a mindset for continuous improvement in programming


## Technologies Used

- Java 25+
- IntelliJ IDEA
- Git and GitHub
- (Optional) Maven or Gradle for dependency management

## Learning Topics Covered

- Creating commits with meaningful messages
- Branch management and merging
- Tagging versions and releases
- Writing clear and informative README files
- Comparing versions to identify improvements
- Understanding the impact of refactoring and clean code

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git@github.com:p4bllohenrique/java-hotel-reservation.git
   ```

2. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA (or your preferred IDE).

3. Run the main class:
   ```bash
   App.java
   ```

4. Observe the output and behavior for each version.

## Notes

This is a non-commercial academic project created purely for learning.  
Each version is intentionally different in quality to demonstrate progress.  
Suggestions and pull requests are welcome for educational purposes.

## Future Ideas (for continued learning)

- Add file or database persistence
- Implement unit tests
- Add exception handling and logging
- Create a simple text-based or GUI interface
- Refactor using design patterns (for example, MVC)
